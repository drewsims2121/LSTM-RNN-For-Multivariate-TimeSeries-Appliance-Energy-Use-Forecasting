# LSTM-RNN-For-Multivariate-TimeSeries-Appliance-Energy-Use-Forecasting
LSTM RNN to forecast future energy usage by appliances in a home using multivariate time series data

**The goal of this project is to use an LSTM RNN to forecast future energy use of appliances within an home via multivariate time series data**

**Energy uses of appliances in a low energy building were tracked with a data interval of 10 min between each collection point. This study occured for 4.5 months. This was measured by a wireless sensor network. The house temperature and humidity conditions were monitored in conjuction with the appliance energy uses. The temperature and humidity conditions were logged every 3.3 minutes. Weather from a nearby airport weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium) was also downloaded as well to include in this study**
